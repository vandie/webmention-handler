## We Follow [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
As Such All Code Changes Happen Via Pull Requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your commits and branch names follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
6. Issue that pull request!

## [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) & Branch Naming
The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. This convention dovetails with SemVer, by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.
The commit message should be structured as follows:
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Following on, Branch names should be structured as follows:
```
<type>---<description>
```
